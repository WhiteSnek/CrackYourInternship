# Code Explanation

## Problem Statement

We are given an array of size N where each element represents the number of chocolates in a packet. We are also given the number of students, M, to whom we need to distribute the packets. The packets should be distributed such that the difference between the maximum number of chocolates in any packet and the minimum number of chocolates in any packet is minimized.

## Intuition

To minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum number of chocolates in the packets given to students, we need to consider only subarrays of size M and find the one with the smallest difference between its maximum and minimum elements.

## Algorithm

1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sorting the array allows us to easily find subarrays with the smallest range (difference between maximum and minimum).

2. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - Declare two pointers, `i = 0` and `j = M - 1`, to represent the current subarray of size M.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Loop through the array until `j` reaches the end of the array.
   - In each iteration, calculate the difference between `a[i]` and `a[j]` (since the array is sorted, `a[i]` is the minimum and `a[j]` is the maximum in the subarray).
   - Keep track of the minimum difference found.
   - Increment both `i` and `j` to consider the next subarray of size M.

4. **Return the Minimum Difference**:
   - Return the minimum difference found during the iterations.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N), where N is the number of elements in the array. This is due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
