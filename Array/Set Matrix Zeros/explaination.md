# Code Explanation

## Problem Statement

We are given a matrix with some elements and we need to set all the rows and columns of any zero element to 0.

## Algorithm

1. **Store Zero Indices**:
   - Create a vector of pairs of integers to store the `(i, j)` indices of the zero elements.

2. **Find Zeros**:
   - Iterate through the matrix and store the indices of all zero elements in the vector.

3. **Set Rows and Columns to Zero**:
   - For each pair of indices in the vector, set the entire row and column to 0.


## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(M * N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(K), where K is the number of zero elements (to store their positions).
